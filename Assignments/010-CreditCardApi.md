## Credit Card Processing


### Domain Name
- This is a step in the `Stripe Tutorial` but it's so easy using this particular tutorial that I would get it out of the way.
You will need a domain name for this to work, so please purchase one. 
- A good place is here: https://www.namecheap.com. They have domains for $0.88. 
- Or here: https://godaddy.com. They have domains for $0.99.

### SSL
- The following tutorial is the most pain free way to install an SSL certificate on your server. You need to have your own domain name already.

### Stripe Tutorial
- Now that you have a domain name and an SSL certificate, you can start the stripe tutorial.
- I found the tutorial here: https://stripe.com/docs/examples, so if you want you can look at other tutorials as well.

### Bootstrap Stripe Form
- This is simply a bootstrap form that is built with using stripe in mind. You won't need this until tomorrow.
